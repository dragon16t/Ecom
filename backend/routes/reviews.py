"""
Reviews Routes - Customer reviews shown on Homepage / Product page / Cart.
Reviews are managed entirely from /admin/reviews (no public submission).
Admin can:
  - Manually add a review (name, location, rating, body, tag)
  - Generate a batch of randomized realistic reviews (no AI - uses curated bank)
  - Delete reviews
The public endpoint returns all active reviews; the frontend carousel auto-scrolls.
